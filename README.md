## AbfAuto.exe

The ABF auto-analyzer is a console application that accepts the path to an ABF or TIF file as an argument. It automatically analyzes ABF files according to the filename of the protocol used to record them. Output images are saved in an `_autoanalysis` subfolder created adjacent to the file being analyzed. The [AbfBrowser](https://github.com/swharden/AbfBrowser) web application knows how to display analyses using this folder structure.

## AbfFolderWatcher.exe

The watcher application continuously monitors a database of watched folders. It calls `AbfAuto.exe` as new ABF or TIF files are found in these folders. Because analyses are performed in separate short-lived processes, the folder monitor itself remains isolated from potential crashes or memory leaks associated with analysis operations.

## How to Add New Analyses

* Review existing analysis classes in [src/AbfAuto/Analyzers](src/AbfAuto/Analyzers)
* Create a new class that inherits `IAnalyzer`
* Edit [ProtocolTable.cs](src/AbfAuto/ProtocolTable.cs) to link the new analysis with a protocol
* Edit [Program.cs](src/AbfAuto/Program.cs) to test the new analysis locally
* Deploy using scripts in the [dev](dev) folder
